Group 4 - Keylogger    
The objective of this project is to develop a basic software keylogger that records keyboard inputs on a controlled lab machine. The purpose is to understand how keyloggers operate and the security risks they pose, as well as methods to detect and mitigate such threats.
Functional Requirements:
1.The keylogger must capture all printable keystrokes entered by the user in real time.,
2.Each captured keystroke should be logged to a local file (for example, keylog.txt) along with a timestamp indicating when the key was pressed.,
3.The tool should operate quietly in the background without interrupting normal keyboard usage or displaying active windows.,
4.The keylogger must include a method to safely stop the logging process, such as a configurable hotkey (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+Q).,
5.Each logging session must be clearly marked in the log file with identifiers such as [SESSION START] and [SESSION END].,
6.The tool must be designed and tested to run only on authorized lab virtual machines or sandbox environments.,
7.The program must handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful messages if it encounters issues accessing the keyboard input.
